# A bunch of random codes

Some random codes in (C/C++ and Java). 

* `2048.c` : The 2048 game in C.
* `lcs` : Another game (@Ritesh: Finish this)
* `typo-gnerator`: A simple program to generate typos.  More [instructions here](./instructions.md).
* `blocked.c` : The first step of some random game. Though it is getting segmentation fault at the moment.
* `chromaticno.c` : The graph theory chromatic no algorith try,, Unfinished code.
* `finalchainreaction.c` : The whole chainreaction game fully finished. This is one of the good codes.

* rest of the file are almost junk and not good/unaware of the base
