## Welcome to My Past.

Here are few Codes from my College Days mostly written in C and JAVA. Well if you have reached this far stroll a bit more in the page to know my Good Works. Most of the Codes here are some basic ideas or some game or an interesting try. Dont expect You or anyone to clone and try it out with ./a.out and gcc compiler and check the out in a black command window (thats terminal btw.....).

## What Special

Well when you learn coding initially a thrill generates automatically how these so many are things working with lines of codes. For me being a game lover and also having an awesome mentor in my brother, I felt challanged at things that can I do it. When you understand the logic how it works or in simple words the math for it it feels easy to code at least gives you courage to jump in. Luckily with all my interest I did jump in but unluckily i was late to become frinds with github and its awesomeness. So this repo is a bit old but vintage to me. Lets not talk more shit and go right in to the repo.........

## Repo BreakDown

- **The Library** :- Its a basic C code project when I first learnt file write and reading. There is a books, users database (just two text file), and a .c file with every function in it. Create account, Login, Issue book, Deposit, Update user data, Update book data are the basic functionalities and mostof them are synced into the two text files. Here is the codebase [link](https://github.com/riteshpzs12/College-Codes/tree/master/library).

- **BTech Project** :- This is the project we did submit in 4th year as part of CS794 assignment. We tried to simulate the droplet movement within a microfluidic.
A DFMB (Digital Microfuidic Biochip) has a grid like chamber where we put in a specific volume of Buffer and the sample in a designated position and it is assumed that a droplet moves horizontally direction while losing 50% of its volume for each cell and then reaches the mixing chamber. Then as the mixed droplet disperses throught the chip we tracked tried to simulate out the probable path and guess out the cordinate of the cell where we will have the expected ratio of mixing. We (me and @souravdatta1995) along with this added some more to the solution to find out wastage and also tried to find out the minimum amount of sample and buffer requirement by optimizing the wastage. Here is the codebase [link](https://github.com/riteshpzs12/College-Codes/tree/master/Btech%20Project).

- **Games** :- I love gaming, be it Call of Duty or Fifa or even if it is small one page mobile game. So tried out a few as thrill of coding was raw.
    1. _ChainReaction_ :- This was a single device multiplayer game back then which did evolve later to support multiple device thing. I implemented the basic logic of this game and made a C console game where user can play by giving co ordinates of the cell where he wants to give input. Its a exact working solution of that game just the UI and User control was inferior as it had to run on terminal and I had no knowledge of APP UI. This is a personal todo task for me to do the same in mobile with a few tweaks as I am well aware of APP development.
    
    2. _2048_ :- This was a really famous game at that time and the whole logic was math. I did made it with custom control to select the grid size but to be played in Terminal window. This is exact same fully working solution but with a inferior UI. This is another todo for me to create an APP based on this witha. few tweaks.
    
    3. _Blocked_ :- This is similar to chain reaction but with custom field as size of matrix and a far more optimized coding but unfortunately this is unfinished and still a few things left.
    
Here is the codebase [link](https://github.com/riteshpzs12/College-Codes/tree/master/Games);

- **Grapth and Others** :- A few here and there things with graphs and new computer concepts when I starte to learn. Curiousity mentoring was the reason.
    1. _Chromatic No_ :- This one takes a vertices and Edge detials as input for a connected graph and tries to find out the chromatic no based on
