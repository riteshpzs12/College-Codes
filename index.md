## Welcome to My Past.

Here are few Codes from my College Days mostly written in C and JAVA. Well if you have reached this far stroll a bit more in the page to know my Good Works. Most of the Codes here are some basic ideas or some game or an interesting try. Dont expect You or anyone to clone and try it out with ./a.out and gcc compiler and check the out in a black command window (thats terminal btw.....). 

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/riteshpzs12/College-Codes/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

## What Special

Well learn coding initially a thrill generates automatically how these things are made of it. For me being a game lover and also having an awesome mentor in my brother, I felt challanged at things that can I do it. When you understand the logic how it works or in simple words the math for it it feels easy to code at least gives you courage to jump in. Luckily with all my interest did jump in but unluckily became frinds with github and its awesomeness later so this repo is a bit old but vintage to me. Lets not talk more shit and go right in to the repo.........

## Repo BreakDown

- **The Library** :- Its a basic C code project when I first learnt file write and reading. There is a books, users database (just two text file), and a .c file with every function in it. Create account, Login, Issue book, Deposit, Update user data, Update book data are the basic functionalities and mostof them are synced into the two text files. here is the codebase [link](https://github.com/riteshpzs12/College-Codes/tree/master/library).
